In total 12 independent features with 10886 rows.\n- Missing data or Null values are not present , neither any duplicated row is there.\n- As the data ranges from 1st Jan 2011 to 19th Dec 2012, the cnt of the bikes rented will also be in this time period of almost 2 years.\n- During months of September and October, maximum number of  bikes are rented.\n- The cnt is less in the cold seasons of winter(Months such as Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb) where due to cold, people prefer mostly not to ride the bikes.\n- As we can see, the data contains dates from 1 to 19th of a particular month.\n- As we can from the month wise bar plot , the demand for  bikes at the starting months is quite low as compared to months from March 2012 onwards. There's a drop in the middle owing to cold and winter season.\n- There are outliers in windspeed and casual users which tells us that, the windspeed in not uniform. Whereas the casual user cnt varies as they are not registered and not serious in riding the bikes.\n- The exponential decay curve for the cnt(reg and non-reg) tells that, as the users renting bikes increases, the frequency decreases.\n- For weather_code, in the fourth category i.e (Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog) no. of users renting bikes is much low and hence it's good to drop the feature while doing further tests.\n- cnt for bikes rented in working day is much higher than non working day.\n- During is_holidays, people don't prefer to ride bikes.\n- When the weather_code is Clear with Few clouds, people tend to rent more  bikes for their comute.\n- During the spring, summer, fall, winter, the cnt is more or less eual for the users renting bikes\n- The registered user cnt has higher co-relation with the cnt as compared to the casual user cnt.\n- The windspeed and season has a very low(near zero) positive co-relation with the cnt which means, the windspeed and seasons doesn't have an effect in the demand of  bikes rented.\n- The t1erature and user specific feeling of heat/cold has a moderated co-relation (0.3) with the cnt. People tends to go ot in bright sunny day when the t1 is normal whereas as during harsh conditions such as too hot or too cold, the demand in the  bikes has seen a considerable dip.\n- The casual users who rents  bikes likes to ride the bikes as the t1erature is suitable.\n- When there's a is_holiday, user cnt has seen a considerable dip whereas in working days, the cnt is normal.\n- **2 sample t-test:**\n    - The distribution of the population samples is right-skwed and it's not normal which violates is our assumption for conducting 2 sample t test. Also the varaince of the samples is unequal.Hence we will do log-transformation\n    - We got a p-value of 0.91 which is greater than 0.05 and hence we can say that we can accept the null hypothesis. We will confirm after log - transformation as well\n    - After taking log on the sample population, we get a near normal distribution with variance very similar to each other. So we can calculate the p-value and test-statistics.\n    - Conclusion : As the p value > alpha(0.05) , we accept H0 and thus we can say that the cnt of renting of  bikes in both working and non-working days is equal. And we can confirm this using the boxplot as well.\n- **Chi-Square test:**\n    - p- value (6.734426550686341e-08) < alpha(0.05) --> so we can reject H0 Which means weather_code and seasons have a significant dependency and Both weather_code and seasons are not independent of each other\n    - We can conclude that our (chi_stat > chi_critical), we can reject the H0 as we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, so it seems like weather_code and Seasons are dependent on each other.\n- **One-way Anova:**\n    - Even after taking log, the distribution is not exactly normal. So our assumption doesn't holds true. Also, we have confirmed with the statistical test -Shapiro wilk test that the series is not normal. Still we will be going ahead with the test just to check the results.\n    - As the p value < alpha(0.05) , we reject H0 and thus we can conclude that cnt of bikes differs with a change in weather_code.\n    - As the p value < alpha(0.05) , we reject H0 and thus we can conclude that cnt of bikes differs with a change in season.\n\n**In order to conclude, we can say that the major factors affecting the count of bikes rented are season and weather_code. The working and non working days can't be considered as a significant factor in predicting the future of rental business. At the same time, the business team must focus on the months other than winter months for increasing the bike parking zones as during the winter months of (Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb), theres's a considerable dip in the cnt. So the team can utilize these months for serving some other purpose such as renting electric cars, etc which can be a comfortable means for commute in cold.**\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
